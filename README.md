# 🦠 COVID-19 Analysis and Visualization

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 data using Python. It aims to help understand the spread, impact, and trends of the virus over time across different regions through data analysis and visual storytelling.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To explore global COVID-19 data, identify patterns and trends, and visualize key metrics such as confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, and vaccination progress.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas & NumPy – data manipulation  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization  
- Plotly – interactive graphs  
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

---

## 🔑 Project Steps

1. **Data Collection**
   - Load datasets from CSV/API

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values
   - Parse dates and standardize country names

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Daily and cumulative case counts
   - Mortality and recovery rates
   - Country-wise and continent-wise comparisons

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Line plots for time-series trends
   - Bar charts for country-wise comparison
   - Heatmaps, pie charts, and animated plots (Plotly)

5. **Insights**
   - Identify worst-affected countries
   - Observe waves of infections
   - Correlate vaccination rates with case reduction

## 📈 Sample Visuals

- Global case growth over time  
- Top 10 countries by confirmed cases  
- Vaccination progress by continent  
- Daily new cases (area chart)
